        “And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they 
        had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.” (Matthew 2:11)<br> 
        <br>In Biblical times, essential oils were used for everything from holy ceremonies to everyday needs. Frankincense and myrrh play a central 
        aromatic role in Christianity as they were two of the three gifts brought to the baby Jesus and today they're used in incense and burned to 
        release their aromatic molecules in some religious practice and ceremony around the world. Below is a handy list of oils in the scriptures. 
        You'll also have a deeper understanding of frankincense and myrrh. The information provided on this site is intended to shed new light on the essential oils 
        that God manifested for natural health and wellness.
      <ul>
      <li>Cassia: Cassia was a key ingredient in the incense used in temple worship. (Psalms 45:8)</li>
      <li>Cedarwood: The cedars of Lebanon were acclaimed for their durability and used to build Solomon’s famous temple. (1 Kings 4:33)</li>
      <li>Cistus (Rose of Sharon): This rock rose has a sweet, honey-like scent and may be the flower referred to as the Rose of Sharon. (Song of Solomon 2:1)</li>
      <li>Cypress: This oil is extracted from the cypress tree, which has wood so durable that the cypress doors of Rome’s St. Peter’s Basilica show no sign of decay even after 1,200 years. (Isaiah 44:14)</li>
      <li>Hyssop: Biblical references to this plant indicate that it was likely used in practices and rituals intended to purify and cleanse. (Psalms 51:7)</li>
      <li>Myrtle: Sukkot, commonly translated as the Feast of Tabernacles, includes myrtle branches in its ceremony. (Nehemiah 8:15)</li>
      <li>Onycha: Onycha was an ingredient in the “pure and holy” perfume or incense the Lord commanded Moses to make. (Exodus 30:34)</li>
      <li>Sacred Sandalwood (Aloes): Believed to be obtained from fragrant sandalwood, aloes were a gift Nicodemus brought to Jesus. (John 19:39)</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Frankincense</h3>
      <p>
        To obtain its resin, the tree is slashed to make an incision, causing the tree to exude an opaque, whitish-yellowish resin that forms 
        into pear-shaped tears that, when hardened, can be collected. The tears are graded, with the whitest being the most prized. The essential
        oil is distilled from the crude gum.<br> 
      <ul> Frankincense was used in ancient Israelite temple worship as:
        <li>An ingredient in the perfume of the sanctuary (see Exodus 30:34)</li>
        <li>An accompaniment to the meat offering, which was part of all burnt and peace offerings (see Leviticus 2:1, 16)</li>
        <li>An accompaniment to the shewbread in the outer compartment of the tabernacle (or holy place) and burned as a memorial 
        before the presence of the Lord (see Leviticus 24:7). Burning incense in the temple represented prayer (see Psalm 141:2).</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      <h3>Myrrh</h3>
      <p>
        Native to northeast Africa and areas of Arabia adjacent to the Red Sea. The tree produces a pale-yello liquid from cuts in its bark,
        which on contact with air becomes a hard, brittle reddish-brown. The resin is often exported, then distilled in Europe. Myrrh was used by
        ancient Egyptians, for embalming and as a medicine and an incense ingredient; the resin has been found in pots placed in burials and tombs.
        Known as a wound healer for millennia.<br> 
      <ul>Myrrh was used in ancient Israelite temple worship:
        <li>As an ingredient in the holy anointing oil for consecrating priests, the tabernacle, and kings (see Exodus 30:23-25)</li> 
        <li>In the purification of Queen Esther (see Esther 2:12)</li> 
        <li>In embalming (see John 19:39)</li>
      </ul>
        Principal places of production: Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan<br> 
        <br> Therapeutic uses: Coughs, catarrh, bronchitis, bronchial congestion, wounds, sores, ulcerations, eczema, skin infection, ringworm, scabies,
        insect bites, parasitic bites, intestinal disorders, excess mucus, gum disease, mouth ulcers, fungal nail infection<br>
