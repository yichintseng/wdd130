            <p>In Biblical times, essential oils were used for everything from holy ceremonies to everyday needs. Frankincense and myrrh play a central aromatic role in Christianity as they were two of the three gifts brought to the baby Jesus and today they're used in incense and burned to release their aromatic molecules in some religious practice and ceremony around the world. Below is a handy list of oils in the scriptures. You'll also have a deeper understanding of frankincense and myrrh. The information provided on this site is intended to shed new light on the essential oils that God manifested for natural health and wellness.</p>
